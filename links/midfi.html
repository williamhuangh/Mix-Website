  	<p>The tool this prototype is currently running on is InVision. This is a web-based fast prototyping tool that allows users to link images together to create a mock app with no real data.</p>
  	<p>Essentially, the tool above is an iPhone simulator. In order to navigate through the app, simply click on the iPhone image above in the spots you would usually touch. The bottom tab bar takes you into four distinct sections of the app.</p>
  	<p>There are two main limitations in the current implementation. First, none of the text fields actually work, so the user cannot enter custom text and have it show up in the prototype. Another limitation is that since we are not working with real code, each screen has no knowledge of previous data or screens that came before it. This means that each hotspot is  set permanently, and we cannot do the tasks out of order. For example, if you switch over to the messages tab and switch back to the activities tab, it will always show the screen with an added activity even if you have not performed that activity yet. This is because when you switch back to the activities tab, the prototype has no knowledge of whether or not you have already added a new activity.</p>
